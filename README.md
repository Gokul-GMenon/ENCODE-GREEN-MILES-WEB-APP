There is a need for sustainable urban transporation model which is safe convinient and efficient. The web-app is a prototype aimed at achieving the same.

# Technologies used
* Django
* openrouteservices mapping API
* Bootstrap CSS
* Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Perks:
* This significantly reduces transport expenses for an individual.
* It eliminates the need for each traveller to book a sperate a vehicle and prevents vehicles from travelling with only one passenger.
* Hence the app reduces the chances of traffic jams as it reduces the number of vehicles on the road.
* On later stages, we expect the service to remove a huge strain on the public transport system hence making it available for a larger set of people.

# How to use:
* Install packages in requirement.txt
* Generate an API_KEY by signing up in https://openrouteservice.org/
* Run the django web-server (Make sure to add members in django database (django admin))
* Register as a new user in user profile and fill deatils to find nearby travel mates. 
* Contact them with provided details and book a cab together!
